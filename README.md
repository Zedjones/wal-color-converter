# wal-color-converter
A small utility to convert a wal color scheme into a konsole profile and to set that profile as the active profile

Not working yet, but will eventually require [Majjoha's color-converter](https://github.com/majjoha/color-converter) as a dependency.
Might eventually expand this to work with other terminal emulators, but I'm starting small for now
